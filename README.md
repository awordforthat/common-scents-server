# Common Scents Server
This is the server for the Common Scents project, an indie perfume categorization tool. More coming soon!

## Tooling
Current dependencies include: 
- Flask
- black (for formatting)
- pyling (for code style)

## Getting Started
1. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` (in bash) or `py -3 -m venv venv` in the Windows command prompt.
2. Activate the virtual environment: `. venv/bin/activate` under Linux/OSX or `venv\Scripts\activate` under Windows.
4. Run `flask run` to start the server. 
5. Navigate to `localhost:5000` in a browser to see the Hello World page. 

That's it! More soon.
